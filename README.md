💡 Software Engineer who consistently delivers creative, effective products in collaborative and cooperative settings under strict time constraints. As a lifelong continuous learner, I completed a 6-month/500+ hour self-directed iOS Developer Nanodegree on Udacity to enhance prior technical education with a focus on foundations of Swift, Xcode, UIKit, Networking, and Core Data. I have proven experience as a software engineer and a manual/automation QA by successfully collaborating and working in cross-functional software development teams of 4-6 employees and contractors who worked as team leads, software developers, and testers. As an educational aide, I’ve assisted 10+ students with coding homework assignments on various topics including Computer Science Fundamentals, Intro to Python, Java 2, and Unity video game development. I am now eager to apply these passions and honed skills by committing to a professional role on a multifunctional iOS development team focused on creating high-quality, innovative mobile applications.
